    describe: 'Resume Hexatyla was a project built in a mandatory 3-months time during our undergraduate year at Epitech. We were 5 in the team to work on this project.<br />The project was a real challenge and we chose to only use a low-level rendering engine to build the core of the project. It has 3 parts, a server, a client application, and a web application. The web application allows to manage the race, map, and tech. tree to help having a modular game.<br />We have been strongly congratulated about the work we put on eventhough we could not finish it in the set time constraint.',
